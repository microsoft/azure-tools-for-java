## Rules

1. #### Storage Upload without Length Check

- **Anti-pattern**: Using Azure Storage upload APIs that donâ€™t take a length parameter, causing the entire data payload
  to be buffered into memory before uploading.
- **Issue**: This can lead to OutOfMemoryErrors, especially with large files or high-volume uploads.
- **Severity: INFO**
- **Recommendation**: Use APIs that take a length parameter. Please refer to
  the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-upload-java)
  for additional information.

2. #### Use ServiceBusProcessorClient instead of ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient.

- **Anti-pattern**: The use of the Reactor receiver, specifically the `ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient`, is an
  anti-pattern. This is because it's a low-level API that provides fine-grained control over message handling. While
  this might seem beneficial, it requires a high level of proficiency in Reactive programming and is mainly useful when
  building a Reactive library or an end-to-end Reactive application.

- **Issue**: The main issue with using `ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient` is its complexity and the requirement for a deep
  understanding of Reactive programming. This can make it difficult to use correctly and efficiently, especially for
  developers who are not familiar with Reactive programming paradigms.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: Instead of using the low-level `ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient`, it's recommended to use
  the `ServiceBusProcessorClient`. The `ServiceBusProcessorClient` is a higher-level abstraction that simplifies message
  consumption. It's designed for most common use cases and should be the primary choice for consuming messages. This
  makes it a more suitable option for most developers and scenarios.
  Please refer to
  the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/servicebus/azure-messaging-servicebus/README.md#when-to-use-servicebusprocessorclient)
  for additional information.

3. #### Disable Auto-complete when using ServiceBusReceiver or Processor clients

- **Anti-pattern**: When using ServiceBusReceiver or Processor clients, auto-complete is enabled by default, but this
  behavior is not explicitly verified or disabled when necessary.
- **Issue**: Auto-complete being enabled by default might lead to messages being marked as completed even if the message
  processing fails or encounters an error.
  Errors in message processing might not be noticed since the message is automatically completed regardless of success
  or failure, making it harder to identify and handle issues.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: Explicitly Disable Auto-Complete: When creating ServiceBusReceiver or Processor clients,
  explicitly use the
  disableAutoComplete() method call to prevent automatic message completion.
  Please refer to
  the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.messaging.servicebus.servicebusclientbuilder.servicebusreceiverclientbuilder?view=azure-java-stable#com-azure-messaging-servicebus-servicebusclientbuilder-servicebusreceiverclientbuilder-disableautocomplete())
  for additional information.

4. #### Dynamic Client Creation is wasteful

- **Anti-pattern**: Dynamic client creation refers to creating a new client instance for each operation, without reusing
  existing instances.
- **Issue**: This process can be resource-intensive and slow, especially if repeated frequently. It can lead to
  performance issues, increased memory usage, and unnecessary overhead.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: Instead of creating a new client instance for each operation, consider reusing existing client
  instances.
  It's recommended to create client instances once and reuse them throughout the application's lifecycle.
  This approach can lead to better performance and efficiency.
  Please refer to
  the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/sdk/overview#connect-to-and-use-azure-resources-with-client-libraries)
  for additional information.

5. #### Hardcoded APIs & Access Tokens Check

- **Anti-pattern**: Hardcoding API keys and tokens in the source code.
- **Issue**: The source code contains hardcoded API keys and tokens, which is a security risk. It exposes sensitive
  information that could be exploited if the code is publicly accessible or falls into the wrong hands.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: DefaultAzureCredential is recommended for authentication if the service client supports Token
  Credential (Entra ID Authentication). If not, then use Azure Key Credential for API key based authentication. Please
  refer to
  the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-java-stable)
  for additional information.

6. #### Use SyncPoller instead of PollerFlux#getSyncPoller()

- **Anti-pattern**: Using `getSyncPoller()` on a `PollerFlux` instance is an anti-pattern.
- **Issue**: The main issue with using `getSyncPoller()` is that it introduces additional complexity by converting an
  asynchronous polling mechanism to a synchronous one, which should be avoided.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: Instead of using `getSyncPoller()`, it's recommended to use the `SyncPoller` directly to handle
  synchronous polling tasks. `SyncPoller` provides a synchronous way to interact with the poller and is the preferred
  method for synchronous operations.
  Please refer to
  the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.azure.core.util.polling.syncpoller?view=azure-java-stable)
  for additional information.

7. #### Managing Receive Mode and Prefetch Value in Azure Service Bus

- **Anti-pattern**: Setting the receive mode as PEEK_LOCK with a high prefetch value (e.g., 50 or 100) in Azure Service
  Bus.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Issue**:
    1. **Suboptimal Performance:** A high prefetch value in PEEK_LOCK mode can result in suboptimal performance, as one
       client
       locks all prefetched messages, potentially leading to processing bottlenecks.
    2. **Message Lock Expiry:** Messages in the prefetch queue do not have their locks renewed automatically.
       Consequently,
       the
       message lock may expire by the time they are processed.
    3. **Dead-Letter Queue:** Expired message locks can result in messages being inadvertently sent to the dead-letter
       queue,
       causing potential data loss or requiring additional handling to recover these messages.
- **Recommendation**: Optimize Prefetch Value - Set a prefetch value that balances between efficient message
  retrieval and the ability for multiple clients to process messages concurrently. Please refer to
  the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-prefetch?tabs=dotnet#why-is-prefetch-not-the-default-option)
  for additional information.

8. #### Use These Encouraged Alternatives Instead of Their Corresponding Discouraged APIs

   #### a. Azure service client authentication instead of Connection Strings to build Azure Service Clients

    - **Anti-pattern**: Using Connection Strings for Authenticating Azure SDK Clients.
    - **Issue**: Connection strings authentication is not recommended in Azure SDKs for Java due to potential
      security
      vulnerabilities.
    - **Severity: WARNING**
    - **Recommendation**: Azure service client authentication is recommended if the service client supports Token
      Credential (Entra ID Authentication). If not, then use Azure Key Credential or Connection Strings based
      authentication. Please refer to
      the [Azure SDK for Java documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-java-stable)
      for additional information.

   #### b. Use Azure OpenAI's `getChatCompletions` for Chat Applications instead of `getCompletions` API

    - **Anti-pattern**: Using the getCompletions API
    - **Issue**: Issue: Functionality Mismatch - The `getCompletions` API is designed for general-purpose completion
      tasks.
      whereas `getChatCompletions` is specifically optimized for conversational contexts.
    - **Severity: WARNING**
    - **Recommendation**: Use `getChatCompletions` for Chat Applications: Specifically use `getChatCompletions` API
      when
      generating responses for chatbot or conversational AI applications.
    - Please refer to
      the [Azure OpenAI client library for Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/ai-openai-readme?view=azure-java-preview)
      for additional information.

9. #### Use these encouraged clients instead of their corresponding discouraged clients

    ##### a. Use **`ServiceBusProcessorClient`** instead of **`ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient`**

    ##### b. Use **`EventProcessorClient`** instead of **`EventHubConsumerAsyncClient`**
    
    ##### Anti-pattern:
    
    - Both `ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient` and `EventHubConsumerAsyncClient` are low-level APIs. They provide fine-grained
      control over message/event handling but require a high level of proficiency in Reactive programming.
    - Due to their complexity and the need for a deep understanding of Reactive programming, there is a higher risk of these
      clients being used incorrectly or inefficiently, especially by developers who are not familiar with Reactive
      paradigms.

    ##### Issue:

    ##### a. **ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient**

   - **Anti-pattern**: The `ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient` is considered an anti-pattern because it demands detailed
   handling of messages, which can be overly complex and unnecessary for most common use cases.
   - **Severity: WARNING**
   - **Recommendation**: Instead of using `ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient`, it is recommended to
     use `ServiceBusProcessorClient`. The `ServiceBusProcessorClient` is a higher-level abstraction that simplifies
     message consumption, making it a more suitable option for most developers and scenarios.
   - Please refer to
     the [Azure Service Bus client for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/servicebus/azure-messaging-servicebus/README.md#when-to-use-servicebusprocessorclient)
     for more information.

    ##### b. **EventHubConsumerAsyncClient**
    
    - **Anti-pattern**: The `EventHubConsumerAsyncClient` is considered an anti-pattern due to its low-level nature and the
    complexity involved in event handling.
    - **Severity: WARNING**
    - **Recommendation**: Instead of using `EventHubConsumerAsyncClient`, it is advised to use `EventProcessorClient`.
    The `EventProcessorClient` provides a higher-level abstraction that simplifies event processing, making it the
    preferred choice for most developers.
    - Please refer to
    the [EventProcessorClient Class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient?view=azure-java-stable)
    for more information.

10. #### Using Batch Operations Instead of Single Operations in a Loop

- **Anti-pattern**: Calling a single operation in a loop when a batch operation API exists in the SDK that can handle
  multiple actions in one request.
- **Issue**:
    - Repeatedly calling a single operation in a loop leads to multiple network requests, which can be inefficient and
      slow.
    - Multiple requests also consume more resources (e.g., network bandwidth, server processing) compared to a single
      batch request.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: Use Batch Operations: If the SDK provides a batch operation API, use it to perform multiple
  actions in a single request.

11. #### EventProcessorClient: Using `updateCheckpointAsync()` API of EventBatchContext object:
    #### Anti-pattern a. Without `block()` or `block(timeout)`
    
    - **Issue**: Calling `updateCheckpointAsync()` without `block()` will not do anything.
    - **Severity: WARNING**
    - **Recommendation**: Use `block()` operator with a timeout or consider using the synchronous
      version `updateCheckpoint()`.
    
    #### Anti-pattern b. With `subscribe()`
    
    - **Issue**: If you call `subscribe()` with `updateCheckpointAsync()`, you might get the next batch of events before
      you
      finish checkpointing the previous batch, or you might have checkpointing of several batches happening out of order
    - **Severity: WARNING**
    - **Recommendation**: Instead of `subscribe()`, call `block()` or `block()` with timeout, or use the synchronous
      version
      `updateCheckpoint()`.

     Please refer to
     the [updateCheckpointAsync documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.models.eventbatchcontext?view=azure-java-stable#com-azure-messaging-eventhubs-models-eventbatchcontext-updatecheckpointasync())
     for additional information.


12. #### Kusto Queries Having a Time Interval in the Query String

- **Anti-pattern**: Writing KQL queries with hard-coded time intervals directly in the query string.
- **Issue**: This approach makes queries less flexible and harder to troubleshoot.
- **Recommendation**: Consider using the `QueryTimeInterval` parameter in the client method parameters to specify the
  time interval for the query.
  By passing the time range as an argument in the method call, you make it easier to troubleshoot and understand the
  context of an API call.
  Please refer to
  the [QueryTimeInterval Class documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.azure.monitor.query.models.querytimeinterval?view=azure-java-stable)
  for additional information.

13. #### Authenticating a Non-Azure OpenAI Client with KeyCredential

- **Anti-pattern**: Assigning the endpoint value when creating a Non-Azure OpenAI client using the KeyCredential in
  .credential(KeyCredential).
- **Issue**: KeyCredential is the only required parameter in `.credential(KeyCredential)` for authenticating requests to
  non-Azure OpenAI APIs.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: Omit Endpoint: Only specify the endpoint parameter if you are working with Azure OpenAI services
  that require it. Otherwise, it is not necessary to authenticate non-Azure Open-AI clients.
  Please refer to
  the [KeyCredential Class documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.azure.core.credential.keycredential?view=azure-java-stable)
  for more information.

14. #### Use sync client operation if calling blocking calls on asynchronous operations of an Azure asynchronous client.

- **Anti-Pattern**: Calling blocking calls on asynchronous operations of an Azure asynchronous client. This practice
  turns an asynchronous operation into a synchronous
  one.
- **Issue**: Blocking calls go against the non-blocking nature of reactive streams.
  It can lead to performance issues because it blocks one of the few available threads.
  In reactive applications, avoiding blocking operations is crucial for scalability and responsiveness.
- **Severity Level: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: If you find yourself frequently using blocking calls in your code, consider switching to the sync
  client.
  The sync client performs operations synchronously without requiring locking calls.
  Using the sync client can make your code more straightforward and easier to understand.

15. #### Upgrading library versions if versions in use known to have performance or reliability issues

- **Anti-pattern**: Using library versions known to have performance or reliability issues.
- **Issue**: Using outdated library versions can lead to performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and
  compatibility
  issues.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: Upgrade to the Latest Minor Version. It's recommended to upgrade to the latest minor version of
  the
  library to benefit from performance improvements, bug fixes, and security patches. Importantly, if you encounter any
  issues while using Service Bus Clients, you should first attempt to solve them by upgrading to the latest version of
  the Service Bus SDK. Please refer to
  the [ServiceBus Azure SDK Java documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/sdk/troubleshooting-messaging-service-bus-overview#upgrade-to-715x-or-latest)
  for more information on the latest version of the Service Bus SDK.

16. #### Using Incompatible Versions of Dependencies

- **Anti-pattern**: Using incompatible versions of dependencies in the project.
- **Issue**: Incompatible versions of dependencies can lead to runtime errors, classpath conflicts, and unexpected
  behavior.
- **Severity: WARNING**
- **Recommendation**: Use a consistent version of dependencies across the project. It's recommended to use a consistent
  version of dependencies across the project to avoid compatibility issues and ensure smooth integration. Please refer
  to
  the [Troubleshoot dependency version conflicts documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/sdk/troubleshooting-dependency-version-conflict)
  for additional information on resolving dependency version conflicts.
